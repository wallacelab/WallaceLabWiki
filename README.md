# Welcome to the Wallace Lab

FIXME: Add an intro here

## Guite to repos
All repos in the lab Github Organization follow a standard naming convention, starting with a specific prefix and using hyphens as the only punctuation (not underscores or the like, just to keep things standard).

Prefixes:
* `lab-` : Lab administration stuff (like this Wiki, monthly figures, etc.)
* `paper-` : Code tied to a specific publication. The repo name should also include a year (e.g., `proj-maize-phyllosphere-2014`), usually the year of submission or publication
* `collab-`: Collaborations with other labs/users
* `proj-`: Project code (uncommon; most projects are kept in people's individual accounts)
