# Welcome to the Wallace Lab

FIXME: Add an intro here

## Guite to repos
All repos in the lab follow a standard naming convention:
* All lower-case
* Use hyphens (-) in place of spaces and any other punctuation (not underscores or periods or such)
* Start with a specific prefix
  * `lab-` : Lab administration stuff (like this Wiki, monthly figures, etc.)
  * `paper-` : Code tied to a specific publication. The repo name should also include a year (e.g., `proj-maize-phyllosphere-2014`), usually the year of submission or publication
  * `collab-`: Collaborations with other labs/users
  * `proj-`: Project code (uncommon; most projects are kept in people's individual accounts)

Examples: `lab-monthly-figures`, `paper-maize-phyllosphere-2014`, etc.
